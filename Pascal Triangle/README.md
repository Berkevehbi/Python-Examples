# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Description
This project is a Python program that generates and prints Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern of numbers that starts with 1 at the top and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This program allows you to specify the number of rows in the triangle and then generates and displays it.

## Motivation
I created this project to improve my Python programming skills. Pascal's Triangle is a classic mathematical concept, and working on this project allowed me to practice list manipulation, loops, and string formatting in Python. Additionally, creating a user-friendly program for generating Pascal's Triangle can be a useful tool for visualizing and understanding this mathematical pattern.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
5. Run the program by entering the following command:
   ```python pascal_triangle.py```
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of rows you want in the triangle.
7. The program will generate and display Pascal's Triangle with the specified number of rows.

## Example
Suppose you want to generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows. Running the program and entering 5 when prompted will produce the following output:
    1    
   1 1   
  1 2 1  
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1

Feel free to explore and modify the code to further enhance your Python skills and understanding of Pascal's Triangle. Enjoy learning and coding!
